== Welcome Java Developers!

You choose wisely as Java is still one of the most popular programming languages around.  

Robot Services Ltd has provided a basic Spring Boot-based Java application template to 
quickly get you started with your first robot application. It's provided in a 
GitHub repository. You will migrate this template project into your team's Git (Gitea) repository running in OpenShift and start to developing in it.

== Migrate the Java Application Template into your Git Repo

. Open the {url-gogs}[Gitea^] web UI (make sure you are logged in)
. Click on the `*+*` in the upper right and choose `*New Migration*`.
** *Clone Address :* https://github.com/cloud-native-robotz-hackathon/starter-app-java.git
** *Repository Name :* `*starter-app-java*`
* Make sure the repository is set to *public*
* Keep the rest as is
* Click on *Migrate Repository*

== Configure and Run

In this Hackathon you'll use CodeReady Workspaces for development. You should already be logged-in to CodeReady Workspaces as your robot user.

To get started hacking you have to:

* Start a runtime-specific CodeReady development workspace containing the tools you need
* Have your code cloned into the development environment

You could start a workspace in CodeReady and clone your repo manually or use CodeReady's *devfile* mechanism. The *devfile* method is pretty cool, so we'll use it here.

=== Configure CodeReady Workspaces using a devfile

Your repository already contains a *devfile.yaml*, go to the Gitea web UI and have a look if you are interested). To intialize your workspace with this devfile you have to construct a special url: 

* Go to the {url-gogs}[Gitea^] web UI again
* Open the new repo and copy the HTTP clone URL
* Open the *devfile.yaml* by clicking it and press the pencil icon to switch to edit mode. 
* In edit mode change the value of *location*, from 
----
location: 'https://github.com/cloud-native-robotz-hackathon/starter-app-java.git' 
----

to match your own repo url by pasting the clone url


* Click the *Commit Changes* button


TIP: CodeReady Workspaces can work with *devfile.yaml* using the special URL in the form of *\http://codeready.url/f?url=http://gitrepo.url/devfile.yaml* where the url parameter points to the git location of the devfile

If you have kept all naming conventions you can use this url. 

WARNING: Make sure to replace the <robot_name> placeholder !

[subs="attributes"]
----
{url-codeready}/f?url={url-gogs}/&lt;robot_name>/starter-app-java/raw/branch/master/devfile.yaml
----

This will bring up an animated construction image while building your dev environment. Hit the *Back to Dashboard* link at the lower left, you will see your workspace being build in the CodeReady web UI. Click the workspace name and then *OPEN*. Watch your workspace building.

TIP: This can take a couple of minutes because it has to pull the stack image into OpenShift.

You are ready to go when the *Welcome To Your Workspace* comes up. 

* Close the welcome page (by clicking the *x*)
* Open the Explorer by choosing the pages icon in the menubar to the left
* Open the project directory *starter-app-java* with your source code.

TIP: The devfile did all this for you: Building the stack from a custom image, cloning the sources from your Gitea repository.

=== Basic Application Configuration

Because the application you cloned is a template, to make it work with your robot you have to configure the connection details first:

* Expand the project tree on the left and open the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file by double-clicking it
* Change the *hub.controller.uri* (if required) and the *3scale.token* parameter
** You could look up the URI in your 3Scale account, it should look like this example: *\https://api-2445582274375.production.gw.apicast.io/api/robot*.
** For *3scale.token* fill in your <robot name>

Now commit these code changes to Gitea:

In CodeReady click on the source control icon in the menubar to the left. This opens the Git view with the file *application.properties* marked as changed. To stage, commit and push your changes:

* In the Source Control view, move your mouse pointer over the *CHANGES* bar and click the *+* sign to stage all changes.
* On the top bar *SOURCE CONTROL: GIT* press the check mark to commit the changes.
* You will be asked to enter a commit message
* Now push your changes by clicking the *...* button in the top bar and choose *Push* as operation. Enter your <robot name> as username and the password {{OCP-PASSWORD}}.

TIP: If you want to see the changes that you have just pushed to Gitea you can have a look at your current repository in the {url-gogs}[Gitea^] Web UI.

== First build in OpenShift.

You're ready to run the application the first time! But first make sure your team robot is connected to the power supply and switched on!

Again there is more then one way to deploy your application to OpenShift! We'll use the brand new *odo* ("OpenShift Do") command line client here, for other options see the end of this guide. The *odo* client is completely developer centric, it's capabilities are focused on building and deploying applications to OpenShift.

=== Configure *odo*

Bring up your dev environment in CodeReady Workspaces. If you closed it, open CodeReady, click the workspace and hit *OPEN*. Then in CodeReady Workspaces:

* Choose *Terminal* -> *Open Terminal in specific container*
* Choose the *Maven* terminal

Now *in the terminal window* configure *odo* by running:

* `odo login \https://api.{url-ocp-basepath}:6443`
** Confirm insecure connection and then use your credentials (<robot name> and password) to login to OpenShift
* `odo project create <robot name>-java-dev` to create a new OpenShift project
* Change into your project/source directory: `cd /projects/starter-app-java/`
* Tell *odo* you are building a Java app: `odo create java:8`
* Create a URL to access your app: `odo url create --port 8080`
* Build and deploy the first version: `odo push`

Watch *odo* do all the work for you in CodeReady, or go to the OpenShift web console and have a look what's happening in your project (*Projects -> <robot name>-java-dev*).

After *odo* returns you are ready to access your application. Get the full URL to your app (called a *route* in OpenShift) either by running *odo describe* or by accessing the *Resources* tab of your projects *Workloads* page in the web console.

=== Run Robot!

Open the *route* (URL) to your newly created application in your browser. It'll take you to the Python Robot Control Landing Page. To execute the *run* method click the *Run* button. Execution will take some seconds but then the robot should move some centimeters forward.

If the robot moved, your setup is good and ready to go for the Hackathon!

== Start Hacking

To get started with programming open the file *src/main/java/io/openshift/booster/service/RobotEndpoint.java* and then edit the *run* method.

Currently our robot is driving 10 cm forward. We want to let it drive 15 cm, so go ahead and find the parameter where the distance is set and change it accordingly. Re-build the app with the new code using *odo* by running `odo push` again.  

After *odo* has finished reload your control application, hit the *Run* button and see if your code changes are in effect.

== Final Remarks

You might have noticed so far we didn't push our code changes to Gitea. This works fine as long as you use *odo* to push changes directly to OpenShift, but if you loose your CodeReady workspace for any reason your code changes will be gone. So better push to Gitea every now and then the way you did already.

As a true DevOps team you can be agile during development in your dev project. But for the prod release you'll have to provide a deployment based on a defined Git version using OpenShift's source-2-image build method. For now go through the training missions, we'll explain the source-2-image method at the end of this guide.

== Training Missions

Here are some training missions to get you started.

==== Hints:

* Plan what your robot should do, check the space for the square
* Look up the robot API calls you might need in 3Scale
* Add code in the *run* method and use *odo* to re-build the app
* Test your code by running it from the robot control page
* Push to Gitea regularly

As everything happens in HTTP requests, if you manage to get your program into an endless loop or so, the easiest way to terminate your application might be to scale the Pod down in the OpenShift console. An even better idea is to limit loop runs.

If you want to see e.g. debug messages you put into your code, open the Logs window of your Pod in Openshift.

=== Task: Make your robot drive in a square with approx 10cm edge length

==== Hints:

* Plan what your robot should do, check the space for the square.
* Look up the API calls you need (remember the API documentation?)
* Change the code in the *run()* method (have a look at the commented out code 
examples for REST POST and GET Requests)
* Be aware that the motors and sensors of the robot are not a 100% precise. So you may need to add some adjustment to your turns and moves
* Add some System.put.println commands like in the example to check what the sensors are returning and what the robot is up to. This makes it easier to analyze what is going on
* Push your test versions with *odo*

 MultiValueMap<String, String> paramMap = new LinkedMultiValueMap<String, 
String>();
        paramMap.add("user_key", userKey);
        HttpEntity<MultiValueMap<String, String>> request = new 
HttpEntity<MultiValueMap<String, String>>(paramMap,
                new LinkedMultiValueMap<String, String>());
        response = restTemplate.postForObject(hubControllerEndpoint +

        response = restTemplate.postForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + 
"/left/90", request, String.class);
        response = restTemplate.postForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + 
"/forward/20", request, String.class);
        response = restTemplate.postForObject(hubControllerEndpoint +

=== Task: Make your robot stop before hitting the wall

Setup a barrrier/wall and program your robot so it moves to the wall but stops in time before hitting it. You'll need the forward() and distance() functions.

This is again not programmed in a particularly smart way, it's just an intro. Feel free to enhance!

Notice the exit criteria after 10 loops to make sure we are not running into an endless loops.  

----
 MultiValueMap<String, String> paramMap = new LinkedMultiValueMap<String, String>();
        paramMap.add("user_key", userKey);
        HttpEntity<MultiValueMap<String, String>> request = new HttpEntity<MultiValueMap<String, String>>(paramMap,
                new LinkedMultiValueMap<String, String>());
        
    int loopCount = 0;
    System.out.println("Initial distance " + restTemplate.getForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + "/distance?user_key=" + userKey, String.class));
    
    while (Integer.valueOf(restTemplate.getForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + "/distance?user_key=" + userKey, String.class)) > 100 && loopCount < 10  )
    {
        
        System.out.println("Loop run " + i + " , current distance " + restTemplate.getForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + "/distance?user_key=" + userKey, String.class));
        
        response = restTemplate.postForObject(hubControllerEndpoint + "/forward/5", request, String.class);
        loopCount++;
                
    }

+++ </div></details> +++

TIP: You may wrap your REST calls into functions to make them easier to use


== Now the Fun Starts!

Okay, by now you should have:

* set up a complete Cloud Native Development Environment using Python as your programming language of choice  
* gone through some training missions to get you up to speed

You have all the information to get started hacking the robot!

=== Final Mission

As explained your mission will be to navigate your robot through an unkown labyrinth with a combination of driving and distance checks. So prepare and test your robot with different maze variations.

== Feature Freeze!

When it's time for the final challenge you have to build your production release.  

=== Build and Deploy App with Source-2-Image

To build the final release, follow these steps:

* Make sure your latest code version has been pushed to Gitea
* In the OpenShift console switch to the Developer persona by selecting *Developer* from the drop-down menu to the upper left.
* Create a new project for your production release by choosing *Projects* from the *Advanced* menu.
* Click the *Create Project* button and create a project named *<robot-name>-java-prod*
* Click *+Add* in the left menu and select the *From Git* tile
* Fill in the fields
** *Git Repo URL*: Clone URL from your Gitea repo
** Make sure *Git Type* is set to *Other*
** As *Builder Image* choose the Java tile (make sure version is 8)
** Under *General* *application* and *Name* are pre-filled, leave as is
* Finally hit the *Create* button!

You will be taken to the *Topology* view, the circular arrow icon indicates the running bild process. When the build has finished, is turns into a green check mark.

After the build has finished, open the application by clicking the top right icon to open it.

If you want to rebuild and deploy the production image again after some code changes just go to *Builds* in the main menu and to the right of your Build Configuration *starter-app-java-git* click on the three dots and then *Start Build*. This will trigger a new build and deployment from your Gitea sources.  

Good Luck and Robotz Go, Go, Go!

== FALLBACK : Running the Application Locally

*Open a new terminal* in your CodeReady workspace by clicking the *+* sign and *Terminal* in the 
lower workspace pane. Change into your project directory:

----
cd /projects/<GUID>-robot-app
----

Now build and run the application locally by executing this Maven command:

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

WARNING: You should do this in a new terminal window because you can't stop the 
application with Ctrl-C.

Now your application should run in the embedded Tomcat server. To access the 
application web frontend, look up the URL:

* Again using the *+* sign, open a *Servers* view.
* Under *Reference* search for *8080/tcp*
* Click the URL in the row to the right, this will take you to the web page of your application

By clicking the *Run* button you start the *run* method of the application. 
Using the initial check out this will print a log message you will see in the 
terminal Tomcat is running in.

=== Changing the Application

Now it's time to make the first change to the application code. The code 
structure is standard-Maven, have a look around. The log message you just 
saw is triggered in the *run()* method of Java class 
`../src/main/java/io/openshift/booster/service/RobotEndpoint.java`

TIP: CodeReady behaves similar to IDEs like Eclipse, VSCode and IntelliJ.  Expand the directory structure tree on the left side until you see the file *RobotEndpoint.java* 

As a first example go and change the log message and the standard output:

----
public Object run() {
        System.out.println("Hello <GUID> Team");
        String response = "Hello <GUID> Team";
        // Example GET invokation of the Robot API
----

Open a new terminal, change to the <GUID>-ronot-app directory as before and enter

----
mvn compile
----

This will compile the changed Java files and Spring boot will take care of hot-swapping your code change into the running server.

Wait until this has finished and run again by pressing *Run* on the web page.

Do this as long as you want, the goal is to get familiar with the process.

TIP: When you are finished changing code, close the terminal Tomcat is running 
in.

TIP: As you may know the buildtool Maven downloads a lot of Java libraries for you application
from the internet.  This takes some time during the first compile so be patient. To speed up the subsequent compiles, add the option -o to the command. This will tell Maven to work in offline mode, as it has already downloaded alll required libaries.

=== Deploying the Application to OpenShift

Until now the application runs locally in your CodeReady workspace. To run it as a 
containerized service in OpenShift, deployable where ever you want, you have to 
build and deploy a container image from your application. And guess what? It's easy!

TIP : Up to now we would use the fabric8 Maven plugin to deploy the code directly into the OpenShift project.  There is a brand new developer tool by Red Hat that works even better and supports multiple programming languages.  It is a Commandline Client called odo (OpenShift Do) that is specifically designed for Cloud Native Development Workflow without having to learn or worry too much about the underlying Kubernetes Resources. it is still techpreview
but since we are in a Hackathon, just give it try. If you run into any blockers you can still switch to the fabric8 Maven plugin (see below) 


To deploy to OpenShift, in the terminal follow these steps:

Login to OpenShift
[subs="attributes"]
----
odo login https://master.{url-ocp-basepath} -u <GUID> -p ...Your Password...
----

TIP: Make sure you are in the project folder

Tell odo that you are using a java project:
----
odo create java
----

Expose the url of your application :
----
odo url create --port 8080
----
Now push your code to the OpenShift
----
odo push
----

*Wait until the odo push is finished
*This will compile your Java code, create a Docker image from it, push the image to the OpenShift container registry and then deploy it to your OpenShift project. 
*This time, the command will return because the code was deployed in a 
container/pod in OpenShift. 
*Go to the OpenShift web console and open your project. 
*The route to externally access the application will be visible in the upper right 
corner. It will look like:

[subs="attributes"]
----
http://hub-controller-live-<GUID>-project.apps.{url-ocp-basepath} 
----

Clicking the route will take you to your applications web page again. But this 
time in the running in cloud!

Try running the *run()* method again, it should do the same as before. To see 
the log message, click the blue circle with the pod name in the OpenShift Console and click on the 
*Logs* tab. This is also the first place to look at when your checking for issues
with you deployed application.

 

Now your basic development and deployment workflow is ready. 

== Training Mission



Now return to the main instruction document 

=== FALLBACK: Use fabric8 to deploy your application instead of odo

==== Login *oc* to OpenShift from CodeReady workspace

Before deploying applications from your CodeReady workspace to OpenShift, you have to 
login with the OpenShift CLI-client (oc) into the OpenShift environment. The odo (OpenShift Do) CLI will use the existing oc connection to deploy you application directly into your OpenShift project. 

Get the login string from the OpenShift web UI:

* In the web UI, click the top right question mark, choose *Command Line Tools*
* Now a form opens, copy the *oc login...* string *using the copy button*
* Accept the self signed certificate with *y*
* Go to the CodeReady Terminal window in lower workspace pane and paste the command, then press *Enter*
* You should see a welcome message as you are now logged into OpenShift
* Try running `oc whoami` to make sure you are logged in

==== Deploying the Application to OpenShift

Until now the application runs locally in your CodeReady workspace. To run it as a 
containerized service in OpenShift, deployable where ever you want, you have to 
build and deploy a container image from your application. And guess what? It's 
easy!

To deploy to OpenShift, in the terminal enter and run:

----
mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
----

This will compile your Java code, create a Docker image from it, push the image to the OpenShift container registry and then deploy it to your OpenShift project. This time, the command will return because the code was deployed in a 
container/pod in OpenShift. Go to the OpenShift web console and open your 
project. You might see the build still running. The application is running successfully when you see the blue circle. The 
route to externally access the application will be visible in the upper right 
corner. It will look like:

[subs="attributes"]
----
http://hub-controller-live-<GUID>-project.apps.{url-ocp-basepath} 
----

Clicking the route will take you to your applications web page again. But this 
time in the running in cloud!

Try running the *run()* method again, it should do the same as before. To see 
the log message, click the blue circle with the pod name in the OpenShift Console and click on the 
*Logs* tab. This is also the first place to look at when your checking for issues
with you deployed application.

TIP: As you may know the buildtool Maven downloads a lot of Java libraries for you application
from the internet.  This takes some time during the first compile so be patient. To speed up the subsequent compiles, add the option -o to the command. This will tell Maven to work in offline mode, as it has already downloaded alll required libaries.
